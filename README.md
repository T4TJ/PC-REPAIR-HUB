# PC-REPAIR-HUB

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The aim of this project is to determine:

1. The common problems the customers faced with their laptop(PC)

2. The total revenue generated and each monthly revenue

3. And the company wants to see the daily trend for the count of PCs issues

I used Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Excel to carry out this project by cleaning the raw data, and using appropriate charts, colour for the visualisation.
